What can you do with regex

Test (see if it's in there)

Extract (extract a portion)

Change (change and replace a portion of a string)

// Testing a string

"Use the force"
/force/ =~ "use the force"

=~  (the operator, basic matching operator for ruby)
(this returns a number locatoin where it matches)

/dark side/ !~ "Use the force"
returns true if not in the regular expression

// MatchData class (included in ruby)
string = "The force will be with you always"

m = /force/.match(string)
=> #<MatchData "force">

m.to_s =>"force"

m.pre_match =>"The "   (this returns the portion of the string before
the match)
space is significant in regular expressions

m.post_match
=> " will be with you always"
